                <h2>Innovative Audio Tools from Istanbul</h2>
                <p>Soundtrackistanbul is a company established to create tools in the field of audio programming. As someone who lives in Istanbul and draws inspiration from the city's soundscape, I use this platform to share the plugins I develop with the help of artificial intelligence.</p>
                <p>I work with the JUCE framework and C++ to design performance-oriented audio instruments. These tools are optimized for ARM-based systems and aim to use minimal CPU and memory while delivering high efficiency. As a composer actively involved in music for games, films, and production libraries, I focus on creating practical and useful instruments for real-world scenarios.</p>

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Soundtrackistanbul was founded to explore new possibilities in the world of audio programming and plugin development. Based in Istanbul, I find endless inspiration in the rhythms and textures of this city. My goal is to turn those impressions into sound tools that are both creative and technically solid.</p>
            <p>The journey of Soundtrackistanbul began as a personal exploration into combining music, code, and technology in meaningful ways. With a background in both composition and design, I bring a practical perspective to my development process. I use the JUCE framework and C++ to build audio plugins and instruments that are efficient and accessible.</p>
            <p>These tools are optimized for modern systems including Apple's ARM-based chips, and designed to be as light as possible on system resources without compromising on sound quality. Each plugin is created with the mindset of a composer and sound designer who understands real-world needs.</p>
            <p>As someone who has composed music for games, films, and production libraries, I aim to build instruments that I would personally want to use in my own projects. Soundtrackistanbul is a place where creativity meets functionality, and I hope that these tools will help other musicians and creators bring their ideas to life.</p>
            <p>Thank you for being here, and I hope you find something that inspires you.</p>
